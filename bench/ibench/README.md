# AutoDBA - Vacuum Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the PostgreSQL AutoVacuum feature using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. By integrating a custom RL model with PostgreSQL, we seek to optimize vacuuming decisions dynamically based on database activity, improving performance and resource utilization.

## Components
- `autovac_driver.py`: Main script for the reinforcement learning driver that interacts with the PostgreSQL AutoVacuum feature.
- `iibench_driver.py`: iibench workload to simulate database load and test the RL model's effectiveness.
- `learning/`: Directory containing the reinforcement learning model and training scripts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- PostgreSQL

## Installation
Provide step-by-step instructions to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/crystalcld/mytools
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd bench/ibench
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Describe how to use the project, including commands to run scripts, train the model, and integrate with PostgreSQL.

```bash
python autovac_driver.py [options]
```
